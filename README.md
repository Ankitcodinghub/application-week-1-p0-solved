Application of Matlab for Finance

Class

I Outline of the Course

I Matlab Basics I

Matrices and Matrix Operation

I Indexing and Colon Operator

I Examples What is Matlab?

I A scientific programming Language: MATrix LABoratory I A very fancy calculator

I A tool for econometrics and finance

I A tool for numerical methods, probability, and statistics

I A tool to produce graphics and plots Outline of Course

I Course materials are available on the HUB and consist of

I Each class consists of interactive sessions: a mix of the course leader demonstrating and the class students implementing example code.

I Examination:

I Coursework/Assignment (50%) ‚Äì comment on your code-file

I Class Materials

I Create a directory H://MyMATLAB in your H: drive

I For each class, create a sub-folder Class1 (Class2 for next week, etc )

I Save the files to the relevant folder: H://MyMATLAB//Class1 for today (‚Ä¶//Class2 for next week etc)

I MATLAB Download for personal PC:

MATLAB Layout

I Command Window

I Type commands and display no-graphic output

I A &gt;&gt; prompt shows the system is ready for input

I Current Directory (CD)

I The directory (folder) that MATLAB is currently working in

I Always change the CD to where your MATLAB files are located I cd(‚ÄòH:/MyMATLAB/Class1‚Äô) for today

I Note: Make sure the path name is exactly the folder name you created: if you name your folder as ‚ÄôClass1‚Äô without space, cd(‚ÄòH:/MyMATLAB/Class 1‚Äô) will give you an error message. I Editor

I The window where you edit and save m-files

I m-files: the files that save scripts and functions that you‚Äôve defined/created

I Workspace:

I Store all the variables that you currently created and defined Help

File

I Search Field: right up corner: ‚ÄúSearch Documentation‚Äù

I Type a keyword (e.g. skewness)

I Definition, function usage instructions etc.

I Command window: help followed by the name of the function

I help skewness: on-screen text with usage instructions

I In script help: highlight the function name and press F1 Editor and Comments

I ‚ÄôNew‚Äô ‚Üí ‚ÄôScript‚Äô: create a standard .m-file

I Save the .m file as ‚ÄôMyClass1.m‚Äô, and do the following:

I Change the current dictionary to the folder you created in H:

drive. I Define a 100 by 1 vector of ones named A using ones(m,n).

I ones(m,n): m for how many rows, n for how many columns I Comment on your code.

I % comments identifier

I %%: split m-file into subsections I Execute your code (commands).

I Type/copy your commend in the command window; I Execution by selection: F9

I Execution by blocks: F5

I Put a semi-colon ; behind B = ones(100,1) and comment

I End a command with a semi-colon (;) to suppress the output. I Semi-colon (;) helps separate multiple commands that in

one line Script vs. Live Script

I With a standard script .m file, the codes are executed in the command window.

Write, execute and test code in a single interactive environment

I No longer need the command window with very easy codes execution

I But cannot be used to create function (Class2 for more details)

it, operate on it and save it back to memory. I Variable

names:

I it must begin with a letter

I uppercase and lowercase are distinguished A6= a

I ensure the name is not already used as a function name: myskew vs.

skewness

I All MATLAB variables are stored and used as matrices.

I Elements: numbers, characters, logical statements (1 or 0), etc. I Scalar (1-by-1): A = 3

I Vector (1-by-n) or (n-by-1): B = [1 2] C

I Matrix (m-by-n) D for a 2-by-2 matrix Create Variables

I Create

A

I A = 3

I []: Used to create matrix, not used to clarify order of operations.

I Row vector: separate elements within a row with either a comma (,) or a space

B = [1,2] %or B = [1 2]

I A matrix has multiple rows, separate the rows with semi-colons (;) C = [1;2]

D = [1,2;3,4]%or D = [1 2;

3 4]

I Functions: ones, zeros, rand, eyes E = zeros(1,3)

I Colon (:) to create a sequence of number: [start number:step size:end number]

F = [1:2:7;0:0.5:1.5]

Simple Matrix Operations

Element-by-Element operations

Matrix Indexing and the Colon Operator

I To reference a particular element in a matrix/variable, specify its row and

column number within the matrix with a parentheses: A(row,

column) I A(2,3) refers to the 2nd row, 3rd column element.

I Colon (:) selects the complete rows or columns:

I A(2,:) refers to the entire 2nd row elements of matrix A

Simple Matrix Operations

Element-by-Element operations

I A(:,3) refers to the entire 3rd column elements of matrix A

I Colon (:) also selects a particular range of values in a matrix

I A(2,1 : 3) selects the 1st, 2nd and 3rd elements on the 2nd row

I A(1 : 2,3 : 4) selects elements in the 1st and 2nd rows, 3rd and 4th columns of A, which answer is a 2-by-2 matrix.

I A middle number specifies the step size

Simple Matrix Operations

Element-by-Element operations

I A(1,1 : 2 : 5) selects the 1st, 3rd and 5th elements of the 1st row of matrix A.

Matrix Indexing and the Colon Operator

I A

I Define X = [1 2] with matrix indexing and then redefine X = [1 15]

X(1,1)= 1

X(1,2)= 2

X(1,2)=15%change the value to X(1,2) I Define

Y

Y(1,:)= 1:1:5

Y(2,:)= 0 %Way 2: use functions

Y1 = 1:1:5

Y2 = zeros(1,5)

Y = [Y1;Y2]

Element-by-Element operations

%Way 3

Y = [1:1:5;zeros(1,5)]

Simple Matrix Operations

I Matrix Multiplication AB requires inner matrix dimensions agree: column number of A = row number of B

I Matrix Power Ab requires matrix A is a square matrix

A + B Addition A‚àíB Subtraction

AB Multiplication

A/BDivision (scalars)

Ab Power (to a scalar)

A0 Transpose

() evaluation order

Simple Matrix Operations

Element-by-Element operations

Element-by-Element Operations

I MATLAB supports element-by-element arithmetic operations between matrices.

I The period character (.) distinguishes these operations from the linear algebra matrix operations. I Element-by-element operations require matrices of equal sizes.

I Since the two classes of operations (linear algebra and elementbyelement) are

the same for addition and subtraction, the character pairs .+ and .- are not used.
